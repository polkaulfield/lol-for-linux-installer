## FAQ:

- This project <b>DOES NOT manage League of Legends installations that were done via Lutris or any other source</b>, we do the installation ourselves and we handle our own installation and ONLY it.

- <b> Don't demand features in the bug tracker, open a pull request instead and contribute with code</b>, depending of the amount of work i might be able to pull it off but if things get super complex or are super niche i won't be able to do it.
